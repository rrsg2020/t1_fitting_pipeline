#### Open Questions and Pre-Merge TODOs
- [ ] Use github checklists. When solved, check the box and explain the answer.

- [ ] Review that changed source files/lines are related to the pull request/issue
_If any files/commits were accidentally included, cherry-pick them into another branch._

- [ ] Review that changed source files/lines were not accidentally deleted
_Fix appropriately if so._

- [ ] Test new features or bug fix
_If not implemented/resolved adequately, solve it or inform the developer by requesting changes in your review._
_Preferably, set breakpoints in the locations that the code was changed and follow allong line by line to see if the code behaves as intended._
