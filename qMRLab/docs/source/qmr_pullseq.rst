``qMRPullseq`` is aimed to be collection of vendor-neutral & open-source pulse sequences developed in ``RTHawk`` for qMRI applications. As the name implies, you can pull a pulse sequence from GitHub and run it on your scanner. Currently, only certain ``Siemens`` and ``GE`` scanners support ``RTHawk`` platform.

.. note:: For more information regarding ``RTHawk`` please visit `here <https://heartvista.ai>`_.

.. warning:: ``qMRPullseq`` is in its early stage of development. In future releases, ``qMRPullseq`` will be improved to trigger qMRFlow pipelines to streamline the process of qMRI map generation.

VFA T1 mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A preliminary version of the RTHawk application is publicly available for variable flip angle T1 mapping using a 3D spoiled gradient-echo sequence.
