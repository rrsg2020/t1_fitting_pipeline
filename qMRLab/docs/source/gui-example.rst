Beginner's example with GUI
=========================================
This will guide you step by step in processing a sample dataset with the user interface.

1. Open matlab
----------------------------------

2. Run startup
----------------------------------
Go to qMRLab installation folder (note: replace "PATH_QMRLAB" with the actual path) ::

	cd PATH_QMRLAB

Setup your path (note: you only need to do it once) ::

	startup

3. Download example data
------------------------------
In this case we will be working with Variable Flip Angle Data to compute a T1map. The main input data is stored as a 4D volume, where the 4th dimension is different flip angles. 
For example, in this test dataset, 1 slice at 2 different flip angles were acquired: volume 1 was FA=3degrees and volumes 2 was FA=20degrees, such that *VFAData.nii.gz* is 128x128x1x2. The other optional inputs are a *Mask.nii.gz* and a *B1Map.nii.gz*.

Run this in matlab to get the data::

	Model=vfa_t1;
	downloadData(Model,[])

When prompted, select a folder where you would like to put the sample data 

4. Launch the GUI
-----------------------------
Type this is matlab to launch the main GUI::

	qMRLab

5. Model Selection
-------------------------
On the top left-hand side pull-down menu, select the method we are going to use, in this case, *vfa_t1        (T1_relaxometry/)* :

.. figure:: _static/method-select.png
   :scale: 45 %

At any time, you may use the *Help* button in the *Options* panel to get a description of the model:

.. figure:: _static/help.png
   :scale: 45 %

For the list of available models, please check :ref:`Methods available`

6. Load the data
--------------------------
Load the raw data in qMRLab by selecting *Browse* next to *Work Dir*. Select the folder where you have previously saved the sample data (this will load all the data into the correct locations automatically):

.. figure:: _static/load-data.png
   :scale: 45 %

For a more detailed description of what the input data should look like, please refer to :ref:`4.1	Data format`

7. View the data
-------------------------
You can look at your data by clicking *View* next to the name of the file:

.. figure:: _static/view-data.png
   :scale: 45 %

You can browse through slices or volumes of the data files by using arrows and mouse controls.  
Please refer to :ref:`3.	Data Viewer`.

8. Set up the protocol
------------------------
For this dataset, the protocol will be set up by default with the flip angles and TRs: 

.. figure:: _static/protocol.png
   :scale: 55 %

For your own acquisition, you will have to use an external txt file to load the parameters, please refer to :ref:`6.1 Protocol`. 

9. View the data fit in 1 voxel
-----------------------------------

Before fitting the whole volume, it's a good idea to take a look at your data and how it fits the model. Here, we can visualize the fit in 1 voxel at a time. In the *Cursor* section, press *Select*. Then select a voxel in the image and the press *View data fit*:

.. figure:: _static/select-vox.png
   :scale: 45 %

A new window will pop-up with the results of the fit in that voxel:

.. figure:: _static/fit.png
   :scale: 30 %


10. Fit the whole dataset
---------------------------
We can now fit the whole volume by pressing the large *Fit Data* button.

.. figure:: _static/fit-data.png
   :scale: 45 %

A wait bar will appear while the data is being processed and will automatically when done. From the pull-down menu to the left of the image, it's possible to select the output you would like to view. For example, the T1map:

.. figure:: _static/view-fit.png
   :scale: 55 %
